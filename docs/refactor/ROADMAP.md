# Refactor Roadmap

Execution order, dependencies, effort and risk for all 35 phases.
Source of rationale: [`docs/architecture-review.md`](../architecture-review.md).
**Compatibility rules: [`POLICY.md`](POLICY.md) — it overrides anything below.**

**Legend**
Effort: **S** ≤ 2 h · **M** 2–4 h · **L** 4–8 h (operator time including review, not Claude time)
Risk: **Low** structure only · **Med** touches behaviour-adjacent code · **High** touches a
documented invariant
Context: expected share of one Claude conversation — **Low** < 25 % · **Med** 25–50 % · **High** 50–75 %

## Milestones

| # | Milestone | Phases | Ships what |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Baselines | 01 | Permanent signposts + recorded numbers. Nothing else changes. |
| **M1** | Zero-risk wins | 02–10 | Every measurable performance fix in the review, at near-zero risk. |
| **M2** | Observation | 11–18 | The largest CPU + RAM win. Removes ~30 `assumeIsolated` hazards. |
| **M3** | Palette split | 19–23 | `RootPaletteView` 1126 → ~350 lines. Adding a mode becomes one file. |
| **M4** | AppCore split | 24–26 | `AppCore` 1348 → ~250 lines. Kills the merge-conflict bottleneck. |
| **M5** | Structure | 27–29 | Feature-first tree. Navigability. |
| **M6** | Consistency | 30–33 | One naming vocabulary, compiler-enforced exhaustiveness, harness coverage. |
| **M7** | Close out | 34–35 | Comment budget, final measurement, docs, and deleting the now-dead compatibility machinery. |

**Stop points.** Every phase is a valid stopping point. The natural ones are the milestone boundaries:
after **10**, after **18**, after **23**, after **26**, after **29**. Each of those leaves a coherent,
shippable, self-consistent codebase.

**Reading it.** Phases 02–11 fan out from 01 and are mutually independent — run them in any order, or in
parallel across branches if more than one person is working. Everything from 17 onward is a chain: each
phase assumes the previous one merged.

---

## Parallelisation

If two engineers are working:

- **M1 (02–10) parallelises cleanly.** Nine independent phases, disjoint file sets except 09/17 (both
  touch `AppIndex`) — do 09 before anyone starts 17.
- **M2 waves A (12, 13, 14) parallelise** once 11 has merged and established the pattern.
- **M3, M4, M5 do not parallelise.** Each phase rewrites the file the next one edits. One engineer,
  sequential, no exceptions.
- **M6 (30, 31, 32) parallelises** after 29, with 33 independent from 16 onward.

## Risk register

| Phase | The specific risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| 04 | The snippets consent dialog is also the Accessibility permission gate. Changing its presentation could change *when* the permission is requested. | Phase doc pins the exact ordering: consent → `settings.snippetsEnabled = true` → `Permissions.ensureAccessibility()`. Manual verification requires a fresh TCC state. |
| 05 | Channel isolation breaks and a Dev build writes into the stable app's directory. (Path *changes* are now fine — data is disposable.) | Every path stays keyed by `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier`; clean-install verification. |
| 08 | Parallel scan could reorder the uninstall list or race the `seen` dedup set. | Index-ordered writeback is a hard acceptance criterion; dedup must run after the gather. Verify list order against a pre-change screenshot. |
| 16 | A missed `didSet` silently stops persisting a setting. Worse: the eight absence-vs-`false` checks *look* like dead legacy code under the new policy and are not — they encode fresh-install defaults. | AC enumerates every key; verification wipes the channel and walks all 14 panes to confirm defaults, then relaunches to confirm persistence. |
| 17 | `ClipboardStore` and `QuicklinkStore` are harness-compiled; `@Observable` must not break that. | `Tools/clipboard-test.swift` and `Tools/quicklink-test.swift` are mandatory gates. |
| 18 | Deleting the Combine sinks changes *when* feature-presence reconciliation runs (`@Published` fires before the write; `@Observable` after). | Phase doc requires removing the deferral `Task {}` wrappers in the same change, and verification toggles every feature switch. |
| 23 | The launcher screen owns the flat-selection invariant, favourites pinning, section ordering and the calc card offset. Highest-risk phase in the plan. | Phase 19 lands `Tools/palette-selection-test.swift` first. Phase 23 cannot start until that harness is green and covers the launcher. |
| 25 | `PaletteCoordinator` moves pop-to-root and compact-mode logic, which interact with window sizing. | Verification includes the compact↔expanded swap and the pop-to-root timeout at every setting value. |
| 29 | Moving 13 feature folders breaks the `Tools/` harness command lines. | Every move PR updates `docs/development.md` and `AGENTS.md` in the same commit; `checklists/testing.md` runs all 17 harnesses. |
| 34 | A comment pass can delete a load-bearing explanation. | Triage rule is delete/compress/**relocate** — relocation to `docs/` is the default for anything explaining an invariant. |
| 35 | Raycast import or the snippet Markdown format is deleted as "legacy". It is neither — those are formats Tinycast does not own. | Both on the must-not-change list; `raycast-test` and `snippets-test` are gates. |

## Effort summary

| Milestone | Phases | Total effort |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | 1 | ~2 h |
| M1 | 9 | ~20 h |
| M2 | 8 | ~28 h |
| M3 | 5 | ~20 h |
| M4 | 3 | ~16 h |
| M5 | 3 | ~14 h |
| M6 | 4 | ~14 h |
| M7 | 2 | ~10 h |
| **Total** | **35** | **~124 h** |

Operator time, including review and manual verification. Claude's own working time is not the
constraint — your review capacity is. Budget one to two phases per working day, no more.
